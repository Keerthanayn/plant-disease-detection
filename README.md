# plant-disease-detection
This project uses deep learning to detect plant diseases from leaf images. A CNN model is trained to classify healthy and diseased leaves, helping in early diagnosis. The system is easy to use, supports real-time predictions, and can assist farmers and researchers in monitoring plant health.
